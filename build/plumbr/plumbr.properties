# Properties in this file are used to configure a Plumbr Agent monitoring a single JVM.
# When monitoring multiple JVMs in the same machine, make sure each of the JVMs is using
# a different Plumbr installation to avoid clashing in configuration.

# In case you cannot use the configuration via property files, an alternative is to
# configure the agent is to specify all these parameters in the JVM startup script via
# -D parameters, prefixing each parameter with "plumbr." namespace. So, for example
# you could specify the accountId, jvmId and serverUrl parameters for your JVM also via:

# java -Dplumbr.accountId=a8nd2bar -Dplumbr.jvmId=PtJ -Dplumbr.serverUrl=https://portal.plumbr.eu

### Basic configuration ###

# Your account identifier, binding this Agent to your account in Plumbr Server.
# This identity is generated and embedded into the downloaded Agent configuration for you.
# During a normal usage, you should not be changing the value of the parameter.
accountId=pmkvnsh736re10ol7v3pvis47n
# JVM identifier, binding data from this particular JVM to a correct JVM in Plumbr Server.
# This identity is received from Server during the first run with this Agent.
# Note that when are running Plumbr on multiple JVMs from the same machine, each of those
# JVMs should use a different Plumbr Agent to avoid clashing on the same jvmId.
jvmId=9tRl+1VXNEwftcZQoBEVbWLjeiVwsN2qNejnHfHs5D4=
# Server the Agent connects to. If you are using On Demand Plumbr, make sure the
# value refers to https://portal.plumbr.eu. If the Agent is connecting to your
# Hosted Plumbr Server, make sure you have specified the correct Server URL.
serverUrl=https://portal.plumbr.eu

### Logging configuration ###

# Plumbr Agent log file to log the information separately from your application.
# The path to the file is relative to the location of the plumbr.jar file or absolute path.
logFile=logs/plumbr.log
# Log level. Whenever debugging Plumbr for troubleshooting purposes,
# increase the level to DEBUG, otherwise use INFO.
logLevel=INFO
# Full log configuration used By Plumbr. If you need advanced control over Plumbr Agent
# logging (rolling or naming policies, sizing, etc), you can alter the content of the file.
logConf=/plumbr-logback.xml
# Location of the temporary files generated by Plumbr during the runtime.
tmpDir=tmp
# Whether Plumbr cleans the temporary files after the files are no longer needed or not.
# Switch this to false only when guided so by Plumbr Support.
doCleanup=true

### Proxy configuration ###

# Proxy URL through which to connect to Plumbr Server if direct connection is not possible.
# If proxy is used, this setting is mandatory, other proxy settings are optional.
# An example for the parameter: proxyUrl=http://squid.mycompany.com:3128
proxyUrl=
# Username for proxy authentication. Note that Plumbr Agent supports only Basic authentication.
proxyAuthUser=
# Password for proxy authentication  Note that Plumbr Agent supports only Basic authentication.
proxyAuthPassword=
